# Lune Utils

Common Universal Utility Modules Made for Our [Lune](https://github.com/filiptibell/lune) Projects

*This was made soley to better centralize these common utilities for the scale of multiple different projects*

## Installation

* Via a Git [Submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)

    1. Add a submodule in *your* repository pointing to *this* repository, to a specifed directory (replace `path/to/chosen/directory/lune-utils`):

        ```
        git submodule add https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules path/to/chosen/directory
        ```

    2. For updating your repository's submodule(s), including said `path/to/chosen/directory/lune-utils` (Being the submodule):

        ```
        git submodule update --remote path/to/chosen/directory/lune-utils
        ```

    3. From a Lune script, you can now just `require()` the directory directly due to the precense of `init.luau`:

        ```lua
        local LuneUtils = require("path/to/chosen/directory/lune-utils")
        ```

* Downloading the Repository's `zip` Archive Manually:

    1. Download from <https://github.com/latte-soft/lune-utils/zipball/master>

    2. Extract to any subdirectory of choice

    3. `require()` the directory's path the same as through a submodule, easy!

* Using the [Wax](https://github.com/latte-soft/wax)-Bundled Distribution of the Utils

    1. Download the [latest `lune-utils.luau`](https://github.com/latte-soft/lune-utils/releases/latest/download/lune-utils.luau) from the [Releases page](https://github.com/latte-soft/lune-utils/releases)

    2. `require()` the script in the exact same way, just instead of a directory:

        ```lua
        local LuneUtils = require("lune-utils")
        ```

## Usage

You must define a reference to `lune-utils` to utilize its members, like so:

```lua
local LuneUtils = require("lune-utils")
```

With that, you can index any module from this repo's [lib](lib) directory; for example:

```lua
print(LuneUtils.StringUtils.DirectoryOfFilePath("path/to/file.txt"))
-- > path/to/
```
